\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
One copy of an abstract, printed on a single sheet of A4 paper,
must be submitted loose with each copy of the soft‐bound thesis. The abstract must
contain the title of the thesis and the author's full names as a heading and may be
single spaced. Two copies of an abstract must be submitted loose with the final
hard‐bound copy.
\\

It is suggested that the abstract be structured as follows:
\newline
Problem: What you tackled, and why this needed a solution
\newline
Objectives: What you set out to achieve, and how this addressed the problem
\newline
Methodology: How you went about solving the problem
\newline
Achievements: What you managed to achieve, and how far it meets your objectives.

\section{State of The Art}
Summarise current knowledge and what others have done in the various topics of your dissertation – in the application area and in the various technologies that you might have used or did use. Write for someone familiar with computing, but not necessarily expert in the particular topics of your project. Give references to other work by using cross-references to entries in the References section, like this REF

\section{Appendix 1 - Technical References}
You may have one or more appendices containing detail, bulky or reference material that is relevant though supplementary to the main text: perhaps additional specifications, tables or diagrams that would distract the reader if placed in the main part of the dissertation. Make sure that you place appropriate cross-references in the main text to direct the reader to the relevant appendices.
Note that you should not include your program listings as an appendix or appendices. You should submit one copy of such bulky text as a separate item, perhaps on a disk.
\clearpage
\section{Appendix 2 - UserGuide}
If you produced software that is intended for others to use, or that others may wish to ex-tend/improve, then a user guide and an installation guide appendices are essential.
